# Johann Jungbauer - Software Developer

I've worked as a fullstack developer since 2014. Mainly worked with Java frameworks, Javascript, and worked in Unix environments.

If you're looking for my master's work both repos are on BitBucket. The [thesis LaTex code is here](https://bitbucket.org/johann_jungbauer/masters_thesis/src/master/) and the [HTN code is here](https://bitbucket.org/johann_jungbauer/masters_fsm/src/master/).
